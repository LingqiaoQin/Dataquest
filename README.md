####Solutions of [dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/learn) missions in Haxe language

I want to learn more about Data Analysis and Data Engineering. The tutorial is for the Python language. Because the project I want to use this for is written in Haxe I want to find out if I can use the Python compile target of Haxe to do this.

Every mission contains the following files

- **compile.hxml**  
Instructions for the Haxe compiler to create the Python script.
If you don't use Haxedevelop you can compile the Haxe code with this script.

- **Project.hxproj**  
Projekt file for users of Haxedevelop

- **Run.bat**  
Batch file to run the Pyhon script

- **Script.hx**  
Haxe sourcecode

- **script.py**  
Python sourcecode created by the Haxe compiler
